                    <p>Welcome to my blog "Organized Mess", a place my mind will dump a variety of content, from anime/manga/video game reviews, to personal thoughts and my own writings. I thought I'd christen my blog with a little about me and my journey
                        to now.</p><br><br>
                    <p>Professionally, Iâ€™ve been an IT guy for over 10 years, but my love of technology and computers started when I was 2 years old with my first gaming console, the Atari 2600. I was immediately hooked with Pitfall and Pac-man, followed
                        by an Apple IIe PC a few years later. Games basically became my life from that point on, and I was entranced with the concept of games. How they played, looked, the story, music, and more, I fell in love with games, and like most
                        every other kid I'm sure, I wanted to be a game developer because I loved the thought of putting the ideas in my head into the world.</p><br><br>
                    <img src="../blog_images/apple2e.jpg" alt="Apple IIe and Oregon Trail"><br><br>
                    <p>Fast forward a decade or so to my high school days in the late 90's, where one of my first elective classes was web design. Back then, CSS was barely in existence and I had no clue it even existed, so I was creating every website in
                        pure HTML (...yeah). I've never been great at design or being artistic, so I ended up leaving it in the dust and moving on to more IT-based studies, and a C++ stint in college that I ended up dropping because the teacher was terrible
                        and made me hate it.</p><br><br>
                    <p>Fast forward once again to late 2019, where I'm a 34 year old re-discovering software development by chance after reading an off-hand comment somewhere online. I immediately fell down the rabbit hole looking at all the programming
                        languages, not realizing just how many were out there, and I got incredibly excited with all of the choices! I knew this was the path I wanted to pursue, no matter how difficult for many reasons: sake of learning, all of the stuff
                        I can create, a job I will love and enjoy, make more money for a better life, and the possibility of being able to live abroad to name a few!</p><br><br>
                    <img src="/blog_images/thinking.jpg" alt="Critical Thinking"><br><br>
                    <p>I started with learning front end web dev, but the more I got into it, the more I realized I wasn't a big fan of it (I know it seems strange, given you're on a site I created, but stay with me!) At this point, a friend recommended
                        I learn C# instead, so I began and found I really enjoyed how it writes and looks. While I wouldn't turn down a position as a frontend developer, because it would allow me to get my foot in the door, I think my path lies more with
                        either backend or another type of development like desktop, mobile, machine learning, or more, only time and opportunity will tell!</p><br><br>
                    <p>Which brings me to this website I created as a place to eventually show off projects I complete, as well as this blog to put my thoughts, ideas, and stories to a written form (I might incorporate YouTube videos later too). I feel having
                        a portfolio site is important. I could have created this site with much better frontend templates and a fleshed-out backend, but I wanted to approach this with all the skills I currently possess, even if frontend is not my personal
                        favorite. This just becomes a long-term, living project I can keep improving on, like adding a comment section, users, and more!</p><br><br><br>
